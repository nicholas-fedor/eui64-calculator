// Package ui provides templated UI components for the EUI-64 calculator web application.
//
// It defines layouts, forms, and result displays using the templ templating language,
// which are rendered in response to HTTP requests.
//
// The package includes components such as Home, HomeContent, Layout, and Result,
// which are used to generate HTML for the application's user interface.
//
// Generated files (e.g., *_templ.go) are created by the templ tool and should not be edited manually.
//
// Tests in ui_test.go verify the structure and content of rendered templates.
